# RunLogger

RunLogger was created for users to be able to keep a history log of their runs. Once signed up with a unique username and email, users can add, edit, and delete records of their runs. Each run has a customizable date, duration, distance, pace (run, jog, walk, intervals), and notes attributes. The runs are displayed and ordered by date on a user's /runs page. More information about each run can be found by selecting a run from the list. The run's average speed will be calculated and translated to what that speed would be time-wise for popular race lengths.
